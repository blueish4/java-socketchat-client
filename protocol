Each packet is a stream of JSON containing multiple pieces of information.
Format: {"message_type":  <--can be either "system" or "message". "system" denotes a protocol section, such as authenticating with the server
	"UserID":  <-- only sent if the message_type is "message"
	"message": <-- message sent. Only sent if "message_type" is "message".
	"status":  <-- Reply for "system" message all packets from server. Pass is 200, timeout is 404, port closed is 403.
	}

Protocol:
1. Client announces entry to room with a system message containing a UserID.
2. Client sends a "message" message over port 49149.
3. Server distributes the additional text to all of the connected clients.
4. When client leaves, they send a system message to destruct their entry in the client handler list
